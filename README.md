# temperature_app
A simple Django-based temperature forecast API that takes any given list of German cities and a date and requests a temperature forecast from brightsky. A backed API with the given forecasts for the listed cities is given as an API. The App was the subject of a trial lecture given at Spiced Academy as part of an interview process for the job. I got the job by the way!
